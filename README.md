> A hands-on playground for experimenting, learning, and documenting 38 different sensors across multiple embedded boards.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
This repository is designed for **self-learning** and **hands-on experimentation** with various sensors and embedded boards.  

Objectives:
- Explore and understand the functionality of different sensors  
- Test and document hardware setups and code examples  
- Record lessons learned, insights, and best practices  

---

## 🛠 Hardware & Sensors
### Supported Boards
- ESP32  
- Arduino Uno  
- (Add other boards here)  

### Sensors Included
- Humidity & Temperature sensors  
- Heart rate sensors  
- Light / Color / IR sensors  
- (Add remaining sensors from the 38-in-1 kit)  

> Each sensor has its own dedicated folder with code, documentation, and setup instructions.

## ⚡ Usage
1. Open the folder of the sensor you want to experiment with  
2. Read the README.md in that folder carefully  
3. Connect your hardware as specified  
4. Run the code in `code/`  
5. Document your results and insights in `docs/`  

---

## 📌 Notes
- All code is for **learning and experimentation purposes**  
- Each sensor may require specific libraries or setup steps  
- Use this repository as a reference for **self-learning and practical IoT experimentation**

---

## 📝 Documentation & Learning
- Every sensor has its **own dedicated documentation**  
- Notes should include:
  - Hardware wiring and setup  
  - Sensor behavior and observations  
  - Challenges encountered and solutions  
  - Test results and data  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap (Optional)
- Expand the kit with additional sensors  
- Integrate real-time data logging and visualization  
- Develop tutorials and guides for each sensor
